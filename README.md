# Arc-Z

ps.: "Z" stands for a very common nickname (Ze) in Brazil naturaly given to people named "Jose".

I recommend the instalation of the [Arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) to enhance your experience, but it **isn't mandatory**.

## Installing
This theme was tested **_only_ in GNOME-Shell 3.18.1**, but i belive that you can install it in every version tht works with the original Arc theme. 

######To use this theme i assume that you have this installed in your system:
1. GNOME-Shell
2. gnome-tweak-tool
3. "user themes" gnome-shell extension

######It's very easy and recomended to install as user theme
- Just Click on download button
- Unzip the content to `~/.themes` (you may have to create the folder)
- Open the GNOME-Tweak-tool and select 'Arc-Z' in the Shell Theme area
